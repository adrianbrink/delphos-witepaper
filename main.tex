\begin{abstract}
Bitcoin created a financial system that is beyond the control of any single nation state. It is a system which is completely independent of central control. What Bitcoin did for the financial system, BlockVote does for voting. In recent examples, such as Catalonia, the central government prevented its population from having a referendum on the independence of Catalonia. Central governments currently enjoy a monopoly on allowing, running and legitimising any form of vote. It is time to give the power of democracy back to the people. BlockVote enables citizens to hold secure, secret and fair elections which uphold higher standards than normal elections. It is impossible for a central government to stop or ban these elections or question their legitimacy.
